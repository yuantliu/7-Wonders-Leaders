Dec 7, 2015

This is a project I'm using to learn Windows Presentation Foundation and improve my C#
skill.  It was forked from https://github.com/yuantliu/7-Wonders-Leaders on November 8, 2015.

As of Dec 7, 2015, the following significant changes have been made from Yuan's branch:

* the server has been separated from the client so it's a separate applicaion
* The client UI has been almost completely redone
* the client-server communication has been changed from using serialization to URL parameters.  The eventual intention is to use HTTP
* the leaders expansion has been disabled, but I'll be re-enabling it over the next couple of weeks, I hope.
* the chat window has been removed.  There are plenty of 3rd-party text or voice chat applications that could be used if you want to have a more interactive experience.


Major features still on the list.
* I am currently working on getting the server to support starting a new game session without having to be restarted.
* change the commerce information so the client sends back what resources were used from each neighbor rather than a
  number of coins to send to each neighbor.  The amount of coins to be exchanged would be done by the server while verifying
  the transaction details.
* test multiple clients
* re-enable support for Leaders, which is currently disabled until the base game is completely working.
* there are a still a few bugs (see problems.txt)
* support the Cities expansion pack
* improve the AI, which is currently quite primitive.
* use HTTP

Lots of improvements to the UI still could be made, such as:
* using drag and drop for the cards
* scaling the main window with the number of players
